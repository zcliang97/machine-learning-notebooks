    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probablistic graphical modeling** is a vranch of machine learning that studies how to use probability distributions to describe the world and make useful predictions about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest model would be a linear equation of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y = \\beta^Tx$\n",
    "\n",
    "* y is the outcome variable that we want to predict\n",
    "* x is the series of factors that affect the outcome\n",
    "* $\\beta$ is the parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the real world has _uncertainty_ so this is usually dealt with a probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "$p(x, y)$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Difficulties of Probabilistic Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose, we have a binary classifier that determines if an email is spam. This is done through a large list of words and determining if these words appear in an email will ultimately determine if the email is spam. However, if this list is very large, then we would have to write down all of these values.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process can be simplified through _conditional independence_ among the variables. This process is called the **Naive Bayes** assumption. Given this assumption, we can model the probabilities as a product of factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(y, x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) = p(y)\\sum_{i=1}^np(x_i|y)$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, each factor $p(x_i|y)$ can be completely described by a small number of parameters (4 parameters with 2 degrees of freedom). This entire distribution is parametrized by $O(n)$ parameters which we can tractably estimate from data and make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graphical Representation\n",
    "<img src=\"images/naive_bayes.png\" width=\"50%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of the Course\n",
    "### Representation\n",
    "This is how to specify a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a difficult process with lots of input parameters. Will use a lot of graph theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inference\n",
    "Given a model, how do we extract useful information. There are two kinds of inference:\n",
    "* _Marginal Inference_: what is the probability of a given variable in our model after we sum everything else out? An example query would be to determine the probability that a random house has more than three bedrooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "$p(x_1) = \\sum_{x_2}\\sum_{x_3}...\\sum_{x_n}p(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference: asks for the most likely assignment of variables. For example, we may try to determine the most likely spam message, solving the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "$max_{x_1, ..., x_n} p(x_1, ..., x_n, y = 1)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Refers to fitting a model to a dataset, which could be for example a large number of labeled examples of spam. By looking at the data, we can infer useful patterns (eg. which wordsare found more frequently in spam emails), which we can then use to make predictions about the future. However, we will see that learning and inference are also inherently linked in a more subtle way since inference will turn out to be a key subroutine that we will repeatedly call within learning algorithms. Also, the tpoic of learning will feature important connection to the field of computational learning theory - which deals with questions such as generalization from limited data and overfitting, as well as to Bayesian statistics."

    "## 1. Elements of Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Space $\\Omega$:** the set of all outcomes of a random experiment. Here, each outcome $\\omega\\in\\Omega$ can be thought of as a complete description of the state of the real world at the end of the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Set of Events (or event space) F:** A set whose elements $A\\in F$ (called events) are subsets of $\\Omega$ (ie. $A\\subset\\Omega$ is a collection of possible outcomes of an experiment).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability Measure:** A function $P:F\\implies\\mathbb{R}$ that satisfies the following properties\n",
    "* $P(A)\\geq0$ for all $A\\subset F$\n",
    "* If $A_1, A_2, ...$ are disjoint events (ie. $A_i\\cap A_j = \\emptyset$ whenever $i\\neq j$), then $P(\\cup_iA_i) = \\sum_iP(A_i)$\n",
    "* $P(\\Omega) = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "These three properties are called the *Axioms of Probability*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Consider the event of tossing a six-sided die. The sample space is $\\Omega = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. We can define different event spaces on this sample space. For example, the simplest event space is the trivial event space $F = {\\emptyset, \\Omega}$. Another event space is the set of all subsets of $\\Omega$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first event space, the unique probability measure satisfying the requirements above is given by P($\\emptyset$) = 0, P($\\Omega$) = 1. For the second event space, one valid measure is to assign the probability of each set in the event space to be $\\frac {i}{6}$. For example, $P(\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}) = \\frac{4}{6}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### _Properties_\n",
    "* $A \\in B \\implies P(A) \\leq P(B)$\n",
    "* $P(A\\cap B) \\leq min(P(A), P(B))$\n",
    "* Union Bound: $P(A\\cup B) \\leq P(A) + P(B)$\n",
    "* $P(\\Omega - A): 1-P(A)$\n",
    "* Law of Total Probability: If $A_1, ..., A_k$ are a set of disjoint events such that $\\cup_{i=1}^k A_i = \\Omega$, then $\\sum_{i=1}^k P(A_i) = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Conditional Probability\n",
    "Let B be an event with non-zero probability. The donctional probablity of any event A given B is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Chain Rule\n",
    "Let $S_1, ..., S_k$ be events, $P(S_i) > 0$. Then the chain rule states that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(S_1\\cap S_2\\cap...\\cap S_k) = P(S_1)P(S_2|S_1)P(S_3|S_2\\cap S_1)...P(S_k|S_1\\cap S_2\\cap...\\cap S_{k-1})$ \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$P(S_1\\cap S_2) = P(S_1)P(S_2|S_1)$\n",

    "### 1.3 Indepedence\n",
    "\n",
    "Two events are called **independent** if $P(A\\cap B) = P(A)P(B)$ or $P(A|B) = P(A)$. Intuitively, A and B are independent means that observing B does not have any effect on the probability of A.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Random Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an experiment where we flip 5 coins and we want to know the number of heads. here the elements of the sample saplce $\\Omega$ are 5-length sequences of heads and tails. In practice, we care about real-valued functions of outcomes, such as the number of heads that apear among 5 tosses or the length of the longest run of tails. These functions under some techincal conditions are known as **random variables**.\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, a random variable **X** is a function $X:\\Omega\\implies\\mathbb{R}$. Typically, we denote random variables using upper case letters $X(\\omega)$ or simply $X$ (where the dependence on the random outcome $\\omega$ is implied). We denote the value that a random variable may take on using lower case letters $x$. Thus, $X = x$ means that we assign . the value $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$ to the random variable $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** In the experiment above, suppose that $X(\\omega)$ is the number of heads which occur in the sequence of tosses $\\omega$. Given that only 5 coins are tossed, $X(\\omega)$ can take only a finite number of values, so it is known as a **discrete random variable**. Here the probability of the set associated with a random variable $X$ taking on some specific value $k$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(X=k) := P({w:X(\\omega) = k})$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Suppose that $X(\\omega)$ is a random variable indicating the amount of time it takes for a radioactive particle to deay. In this case, $X(\\omega)$ takes on an infinite nubmer of possible values, so it is called a **continuous random variable**. We denote the probability that $X$ takes on a value between two real constants $a$ and $b$ (where $a<b$) as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(a \\leq X \\leq b) := P({w: a \\leq X(\\omega) \\leq b})$\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "To specify the probability lmeasures used when dealing with random variables, it is often convenient to specify alternative functions (CDFs, PDFs, and PMFs) from which the probability measure governing an experiment immediately follows. \n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/cdf.png\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",

    "### 2.2 Probability Mass Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/pmf.png\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "When a random variable $X$ takes on a finite set of possible values (ie. $X$ is a discrete random variable), a simpler way to represent the probability measure associated with a random variable is to directly specify the probability of each value that the random variable can assume. In particular, a probability mass function (PMF) is a function $p_X : \\Omega\\implies\\mathbb{R}$ such that $p_X(x) = P(X=x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of discrete random variable, we use the notation $Val(X)$ for the set of possible values that the random variable $X$ may assume. For example, if $X(\\omega)$ is a random variable indicating the number of heads out of 5 coin tosses, then $Val(X) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}$.\n",

    "<img src=\"images/pdf.png\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "For some continuous random variables, the cumulative distribution function $F_X(x)$ is differentiable everywhere. In these cases, we define the Probability Density Function (PDF) as the derivative of the CDF, ie.\n",

    "$f_X(x) = \\frac{dF_X(x)}{dx}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the PDF for a continuous random variable may not always exist (ie. If F_X(x) is not differentiable everywhere).\n",

    "According to the properties of differentiation, for every small $\\delta x$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(x \\leq X \\leq x + \\delta x) \\approx f_X(x)\\delta x$\n",
    "\n",
    "Both CDFs and PDFs (when they exist) can be used for calculating the probabilities of different events. But it should be emphasized that the value of PDF at any given point $x$ is not the probability of that event, i.e, $f_X(x)\\neq P(X=x)$. For example, $f_X(x)$ can take on values larger than one (but the integral of $f_X(x)$ over any subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ will be at most one).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _Properties:_\n",

    "### 2.4 Expectation\n",
    "\n",
    "The **expectation** of a function $g(X)$ can be thought of an a \"weighted average\" of the values that $g(X)$ can be taken for different values of $x$. Suppose that $X$ is a discrete random variable with PMF $p_X(x)$ and $g: \\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ is an arbitrary function. In this case, $g(X)$ can be considered a random variable, and we define the **expectation** or expected value of $g(X)$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbb{E}[g(X)] = \\sum_{x\\in Val(x)} g(x)p_X(x)$\n",

    "### 2.5 Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "The variance of a random variable $X$ is a measure of how concentrated the distribution of a random variable $X$ is around its mean. Formally, the variance of a random variable $X$ is defined as $Var[X] = \\mathbb{E}[(X-\\mathbb{E}[X])^2]$.\n",

    "## Probabilistic Modeling with Bayesian Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that by the chain rule, we can write any joint probability $p$ as:\n",

    "\n",
    "When the variables are discrete, we may think of the factors $p(x_i|x_{A_i})$ as _probability tables_, in which rows correspond to assignments to $x_{A_i}$ and columns correspond to values of $x_i$; the entries contain the actual probabilities $p(x_i|x_{A_i})$. If each variables takes $d$ values and has at most $k$ ancestors, then the entire table will contain at most $O(d^{k+1})$ entries. Since we have one table per variable, the entire probability distribution can be compactly described with only $O(nd^{k+1})$ parameters (compared to $O(d^n)$ with a naive approach).\n",

    "* _Cascade_: If $G$ is of the form $A\\to B\\to C$, and $B$ is again observed, then, again $A \\perp C | B$. However, if $B$ is unobserved, then $A \\not\\perp C$. Intuitively, $B$ holds all the information that determines the outcome of $C$; thus, it does not matter what value $A$ takes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* _V-structure (also known as explaining away)_: If $G$ is of the form $A\\to C \\leftarrow B$, then knowning $C$ couples $A$ and $B$. In other words, $A\\perp B$ if $C$ is unobserved, but $A \\not\\perp B | C$ if $C$ is observed.\n",

If we know that the grass is wet ($C$ is true) and the sprinkler didn't go on ($B$ is false), then probability that $A$ is true must be one, because that is the only other possible explanation. Hence, $A$ and $B$ are not independent given $C$.\n",

    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "The notion of $d$-separation is useful, because it lets us describe a large fraction of the dependencies that hold in our model.

    "In other words, all the independencies encoded in $G$ are sound: variables that are $d$-separated in $G$ are truly indepdent in $p$. However, the converse is not true: a dustribution may factorize over $G$, yet have independencies that are not captured in $G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a way, this is almost a trivial statement. If $p(x, y) = p(x)p(y)$, then this distribution still factorizes over the graph $y\\to x$, since we can always write it as $p(x, y) = p(x|y)p(y)$ with a CPD $p(x|y)$ in which the probability of $x$ does not actually $y$. However, we can construct a graph that matches the structure of $p$ by simply removing that unnecessary edge.\n",

    "<img src=\"images/3node_indep.png\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",

    "The cascade-type structures (a, b) are clearly symmetric and the directionality of arrows does not matter. In fact, (a, b, c) encode exactly the same dependencies/ We can change the directions of the arrows as long as we don't turn them into a V-structure (d). When we do have a V-structure, however, we cannot change any arrows: structure (d) is the only one that describes the dependency $X\\not\\perp Y | Z$. These examples provide intuitions of the following general results on I-equivalence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fact:** If $G, G'$ have the same skeleton and the same V-structures, then $I(G) = I(G')$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, two graphs are I-equivalent if the $d$-separation between variables is the same. We can flip the directionality of any edge, unless it forms a V-structure, and the $d$-connectivity of the graph will be unchanged.
